                    Split into teams of equal players. Each round, a question is asked and everyone writes down an answer without consulting
                    their teammates. Once everyone has written an answer, the teams average their answer out, and that becomes their official
                    answer. Whichever team's official answer is closest to the correct answer wins the round. <br><br>
                    Example: The question is "How many dwarves were with Snow White?" Kyle writes 9, Jonathan puts 4, and Dylan says 8. The average
                    of their scores is 7, so that's their official team answer. Their official answer of 7 beats Chelsea, Sammi, and Becky's official
                    answer of 9, so they win the round.
